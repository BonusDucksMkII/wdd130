                Welcome to my website! Enjoy the weird Scandinavian welcome sign! Fight for independence in the
                trenches of the war reenactment of your choosing! Explore Cartesian dualism! I dunnno, I haven't 
                decided what exactly to put here. I'm just spitballing and writing whatever comes to my mind. 
                This will be a future greeting for sure, though.

                Find the music I've written or arranged here! Some pieces have a sheet music plugin that will scroll alongside the music.
                This can prove useful for practicing or following along with the music being played. Feel free to download the sheets or 
                recordings if you want; just be sure to give credit.

                Here's the computer science projects I've been working on. Some are hardware, some are software. Most of them will have 
                links to a Git or similar page for your perusal and consideration. Most projects will be under Creative Commons License, 
                but some may have copyrights from other companies associated with them.
